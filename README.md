# Blog Project

A full-stack blogging platform consisting of three separate applications:

- REST API backend
- Public blog reader
- Admin dashboard

This repository serves as the **development orchestrator**, allowing all services to be run simultaneously with a single command.

## Repositories

- **blog-api** – Backend API (Node.js, Express, database)
- **blog-reader** – Public-facing blog frontend
- **blog-admin** – Admin dashboard for managing posts

Each repository is developed independently but designed to work together.

## Local Development

- npm
